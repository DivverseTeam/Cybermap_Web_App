          "An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a complete framework of policies and procedures for systematically managing your organisation's information security.\n\nAn ISMS thrives on constant review and development. This gives you the opportunity to identify new threats and risks in time to protect your business before it's too late.\n\n**An ISMS typically has three main protection objectives:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality: Keeping information and data private.**\n    \n*   **Availability: Ensuring that information & systems are available when needed.**\n    \n*   **Integrity: Ensuring that information can be trusted and is not manipulated.**\n    \n\nDepending on the level of security you can achieve and where your priorities lie, your ISMS will be individually designed to meet these objectives at a level that is appropriate for you.\n\n> For example: Very high availability may be necessary for someone who processes orders for a shop around the clock, but not for a design agency that does not usually need to process requests in a matter of seconds.\n\nMost industries have agreed on standards for the design of an ISMS to ensure a comparable outcome and the ability to have an ISMS audited by an independent party.\n\n*   **ISO® 27001:** This is the most widely used international standard for information security. It can be implemented in not-for-profit, public and private organisations. It is a risk-based system, so many decisions can be based on an organisation's individual risk situation. This idea is rooted in many other information security standards, which are often based on the 27001.",

          "Overview\n--------\n\n**ISO 27001:2022** is the International Standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). This standard provides a framework for organizations to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their information security processes and controls. ISO 27001:2022 is a globally recognized standard that helps organizations protect their sensitive information and mitigate the risks associated with information security breaches.\n\nMany organizations, including those in various industries and sectors, have been adopting ISO 27001 certification to demonstrate their commitment to information security. This trend is continually growing as businesses recognize the importance of safeguarding their data and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information assets.\n\nISO 27001:2022 is not just a certification but a comprehensive approach to information security management. It outlines the requirements and best practices for establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) within an organization.\n\nStructure of the Standard\n-------------------------\n\nTo implement ISO 27001, we suggest you to acquire both standard documents.\n\n**ISO 27001:2022** is the standard you will be audited against. This is the main document. It consist of two parts:\n\n*   **Harmonized Structure (HS)** are the chapters at the beginning (4-10) defining how your management system works.\n    \n*   **Annex A (normative)** are the chapters in the Attached table like A.5. These are the technical measurements you need to implement based on your scope. These chapters are called controls and there are 93 of it.\n    \n\n**ISO27002:2022** is a supplementary document that will add additional information and best practices for each Annex-A chapter. You won’t be audited against this document, but we highly recommend obtaining and using it while implementing to get an understand, what the auditor will expect from you.\n\nYou can acquire the current version of the norm either on iso.org (in English) or at Beuth.de (German). If you are unsure what version you should buy, please don’t hesitate to contact us.\n\n**The following guide will cover each chapter of the harmonized structure as well as all control from Annex A with a matching chapter number.**\n\n**Audit**\n---------\n\nThe ISO 27001:2022 assessment process is conducted by accredited certification bodies or auditors. Organizations seeking certification typically begin this process when they receive a request from a business partner or stakeholder to ensure that their information security management complies with the ISO 27001:2022 standard.\n\nWe recommend that you start getting offers for the audit at the beginning of the process, to ensure that your project timeline can be met. We are happy to assist you choosing the right certification body for you, just contact us in the community!\n\n**Scope**\n---------\n\nThe Scope defines what your ISMS will cover. For example, you could only get a 27001 certification for a specific location or department.\n\nUsually, if your company is not over 150 Employees and not spreader over heavily different business areas we suggest to implement the ISMS for your whole company and to chose the standard scope. Reach out to us if you want to get a specific recommendation for your situation!",

          "**Implementation**  \nTo begin implementing the ISMS, start with the chapters from Section 4 onward. Each chapter provides specific explanations and mentions the required documentation you need to apply in your organization. Always keep your assessment objectives in mind as you proceed.\n\n* * *\n\n**Check Progress**  \nWhile implementing your ISMS, it is important to track progress and evaluate your implementation status. Use the following documents to facilitate this process:\n\n*   **Evaluation of Norm Compliance**:  \n    This internal document is used to assess the implementation of the management system outlined in chapters 4–10 (Harmonized Structure).\n    \n*   **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**:  \n    This document helps verify the implementation of controls in the Appendix. It also serves as the official ISMS document describing your control implementation (explained in detail in Chapter 6.1.3).\n    \n\n* * *\n\n**Documentation**  \nBefore implementing the documents, start by editing the **Document Control** policy to define how documents will be managed. This ensures that all documents and guidelines:\n\n*   Are always up-to-date.\n    \n*   Follow a uniform and repeatable structure.\n    \n*   Guarantee the secure and consistent handling of all organizational documents.\n    \n\nIt is advisable to establish where and how documents will be managed before implementation begins. Consider using tools like Confluence or SharePoint to streamline documentation management.\n\n* * *\n\n**The Action Plan**  \nYour ISMS will require you to perform specific tasks, some on a recurring basis and others as one-time actions. Use the **Action Plan Template** to document and organize these tasks.\n\nWhile you may choose to manage tasks within a software tool of your choice, ensure that planned tasks are clearly documented in the Action Plan template. This will be referenced repeatedly in the ISMS Guide. Proper documentation of planned tasks and timely execution will ensure a smoother audit process.",

It reflects the exact boundaries and the area of application of your ISMS.\n\nThe full description of the scope is in the referenced documents, but as an example we described these scenarios for you:\n\n> **Simple Scope:** Your organization has 50 employees that consult customers on IT-related questions. As you want to ensure a high standard of information security, you implement the ISMS for the complete organization without exceptions.\n\n> **Narrowed Scope:** Your organization is a big corporation with different locations and business areas. On your location in Berlin, you are responsible for constructing CAD Data for a specific set of customers. These customers request a certification. For now, the ISMS shall only apply to this business area & location to keep costs and complexity low.\n\n> **Narrowed Scope but complicated:** Same as above, but because of an old contract, some data will be forwarded from an office in Brussel which can not easily be included in the scope. Your scope will describe this interface and you will ensure, that this process is respected in your ISMS procedures.\n\n> **Mixed Scope:** Your organization wants to get high risk business areas as well as the complete IT operation covered by the ISMS. Therefore, your ISMS will cover specific business areas and all IT-structure. Therefore low risk business areas are not object to policies. Because your IT is in the scope, some IT rules (like handling of suspicious E-Mails) are still applied to these employees.\n\nIn most cases, a Simple scope is the way to go.\n\n**Got a question on the Scope?

If your company is large, the management position that oversees information security may not be the CEO - but is part of top management. It can also be a mix: In day-to-day business it could be a single management position that it is reported to, but the management review or other very important meetings could and should incorporate top-positions like the CEO.\n\n**The requirements of the norm a) to g) can be, among other ways, understood like that:**\n\n> _a) ensuring the information security policy and the information security objectives are established and are compatible with the strategic direction of the organization;_\n\nThe management should ensure that the target direction of the ISMS (for example like described in chapter 4) is in line with the general strategy. In general, a close cooperation between management and ISO should ensure that this is a frequent topics in meetings and policies reflect this direction.\n\n> _b) ensuring the integration of the information security management system requirements into the organization’s processes;_\n\nThe management should support the ISO and the ISMS by ensuring that the ISMS is tightly integrated into the rest of the organization. For example, a process that influences information security should be adjusted if needed. The management can play an important role to overcome potential conflicts with other departments or positions.\n\n> _c) ensuring that the resources needed for the information security management system are available;_\n\nThe management should ensure that the ISO and the ISMS have the resources available that they need. For example, if the ISO reports that he needs a certain budget (money or time) to fulfill the ISMS requirements, the management should ensure that the budget is required or the targets are adjusted accordingly if the budget does not match the current possibilities of the organization.\n\n> _d) communicating the importance of effective information security management and of conforming to the information security management system requirements;_\n\nThis means, that the management can play an import role model by communicating the importance of information security and help departments and employees in complying with policies in place. For example, if conflicts or politics inside the organization hinder the ISO in ensuring information security compliance, the management can underline the importance to help resolve conflicts of interest.\n\n> _e) ensuring that the information security management system achieves its intended outcome(s);_\n\nThe management should regularly check that the ISMS achieves what its intention is. For example: Is the budget in line with the plan? Are all risks vor the company mitigated? This also falls partly in the responsibility of the ISO. This position should report accordingly to the management.\n\n> _f) directing and supporting persons to contribute to the effectiveness of the information security management system;_\n\nSimilar to d) the management should support other position to ensure targets of the ISMS are reached.\n\n> _g) promoting continual improvement; and_\n\nThe ISMS should always improve, therefore the management should communicate and promote the possibility to report flaws, potential for improvement etc..\n\n> _h) supporting other relevant management roles to demonstrate their leadership as it applies to their areas of responsibility._\n\nSimiliar to d) and f) the management can support other roles or department heads in underlying the importance of certain policies or rules of the ISMS.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n✅ Implement\n-----------\n\n**We provided some documents for you that you can find in the documents area of Cybermap:**\n\n*   [Information Security Policy](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/information-security-policy) \\- chapter 1, 3\n    \n*   [Management Review Procedure](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/management-review-procedure)\n    \n*   [Management Review Template](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/management-review-template)\n    \n\n**Make sure to implement as follows:**\n\n*   The information security policy chapter 1 is also a way to communicate the importance and direction of the ISMS. The chapter should be checked if the described targets are in line with the message the management wants to transport.\n    \n*   Information security policer chapter 3 is a general description on how the ISMS is structured and repeats the definition of responsibilities for the management. Please check the chapter and adjust if needed. Ensure that described responsibilities are not removed as they are a direct result of what’s described in the norm.  \n    **Note:** If you want to heavily differ from what’s described in chapter 3, we suggest you to check the result with us in the community. We are happy to give feedback!\n    \n*   One way to ensure that the management can control and influence the ISMS is the so called “Management Review” where the ISO will report important topics to the management.

We will come back to this topic in chapter 7.5.\n    \n*   When the information security policy is published, the top management (e.g. CEO) should send out an email to all employees laying out the timeline for the ISMS project, the importance for the company (a sum up of chapter 1 of the information security policy) and the contact data of the ISO (for this, see next chapter). This is to ensure that the policy and the importance is communicated within the organization.  \n    **Note:** This also can be a meeting or a call, but the e-mail / message should be sent out anyways in written (maybe as follow up of a meeting) so you are able to prove it to the auditor.',

          "🔎 Understand\n-------------\n\n> _The organization shall define and apply an information security risk assessment process that:_\n> \n> **_ISO® 27001_**\n\nThis is a long chapter. Let us get through requirement by requirement:\n\n> **_a) establishes and maintains information security risk criteria that include:_**_  \n> 1) the risk acceptance criteria; and  \n> 2) criteria for performing information security risk assessments;_\n\nThis means, that the level of your “risk appetite” should be determined. Basically, Are you willing or able to take more risk or do you want to reduce risks. This decision is often based on your budget as well as the individual situation your organization is in.\n\n> **For example**, think of the risk level a hospital can take versus a company that produces fashion.\n\nAlso, the criteria for performing risk assessments must be defined. E.g. after a certain time or when big changes occurred.\n\n> **_b) ensures that repeated information security risk assessments produce consistent, valid and comparable results;_**\n\nYour risk assessment should be done in a way, that the results are comprehensible, so subjective perspectives are avoided whenever possible.\n\n> **_c) identifies the information security risks:_**_  \n> 1) apply the information security risk assessment process to identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the scope of the information security management system; and  \n> 2) identify the risk owners;_\n\nRelevant risks that jeopardize your requirements regarding confidentiality, integrity and availability should be identified. The priority of these three aspects are also dependent on the individual requirements of the organization.\n\n> **For example**, a web shop that is highly dependent on 24/7 uptime has a much greater interest in mitigating risks that threaten availability than an agency that has a turnover rate of perhaps 24 hours.\n\nAlso, the owner of the risk (“Who can influence the situation”) should be identified.\n\n> **_d) analyses the information security risks:_**_  \n> 1) assess the potential consequences that would result if the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1) were to materialize;  \n> 2) assess the realistic likelihood of the occurrence of the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1); and  \n> 3) determine the levels of risk;_\n\nThe identified risks should be rated in terms of potential damage and like-hood. Based on that, a risk level can be determined to rank and prioritize risks.\n\n> **_e) evaluates the information security risks:_**_  \n> 1) compare the results of risk analysis with the risk criteria established in 6.1.2 a); and  \n> 2) prioritize the analysed risks for risk treatment._\n\nSimiliar as described in d), the risks shall be prioritized. The “risk appetite” we described in a) is a helpful tool: Everything over a certain threshold will be treated with a high priority. We basically will pick a certain, acceptable Level and focus our efforts In reducing risks on these. From time to time, your overall risk situation will improve - you will then be able to reduce this threshold.\n\n> _The organization shall retain documented information about the information security risk assessment process._\n\nSimilar to b), it should be possible to make results comprehensible and traceable. This means, the information to assess a risk and the results will be documented.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n✅ Implement\n-----------\n\n**We provided some documents for you that you can find in the documents area of Cybermap:**\n\n*   [Risk Management Procedure](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/risk-management-procedure)\n    \n*   [Risk Assessment](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/risk-assessment)\n    \n*   [Action Plan](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/action-plan)\n    \n\n**Make sure to implement as follows:**\n\n*   Read & fill out the risk management procedure. The procedure template covers the requirements of this chapter.\n    \n*   Pay especially attention to the acceptance criteria under chapter 2.2 of the document.\n    \n*   **Note:** The template for the risk assessment procedure suggests to start with a rather simple assessment schema especially since at the begging of your ISMS there will be a bunch of high risks that you want to address in any case. As your ISMS will grow more mature and sophisticated over time, the schema can be adjusted to your needs.\n    \n*   As described in chapter 2.4, your risk assessment should be revised at least yearly. Plan that in the Action Plan.\n    \n*   After you described your risk management procedure, assess your first risks!\n    \n*   The risk assessment template already contains a bunch of examples. We suggest to start with 10-15 risks to get into the process. Make sure to cover basic risks (like power outage or natural threats) as described in the example. For now make sure, that you put your time in the risks really relevant for your organization - don’t overthink at that point and rather document what you and your colleagues already identified.\n    \n*   **Note:** Some example risks are for TISAX®-Projects. If the risk name or description contains “TISAX®”, its probably not directly applicable to you - make sure to take a look for inspiration anyways!\n    \n\n**If you need help assessing your first risks, make sure to get help in the community!**",

In reality, you already have a lot of risks treated with Measurements that are also contained in Appendix A.  \n    For example, you may already have a firewall, backups or locked doors. Therefore we will take a more practical approach: We will take the current state and then add what’s needed.\n    \n*   For this, please take a look on the Template “Statement of Applicability (SoA)”. This document is a central part for your certification and will be part of your official certificate as an attachment.\n    \n    *   For every control of the Appendix A (The second part of the 27001), there should be a a justification why this chapter is applicable or not.\n        \n    *   Generally speaking, it would be possible to mark chapters as non-applicable if the controls defined are definitely not applicable for your organization. E.g if you don’t outsource software development, you may mark the chapter as not applicable.  \n        **But:** Usually, all chapters should be applicable as they cover standard measurements for a organization with modern IT. If you are unsure about what to mark as applicable, please get in touch with us.\n        \n    *   Therefore, you could fill out the last two columns regarding Applicability. If you are unfamiliar with the meaning of the controls at this points, you could also fill it out when you are ready to walk through these chapters in our guide.\n        \n    *   Additionally, you should fill out a short description of your implementation whenever we finished one of these chapters. We have included examples of this.\n        \n*   For now, we should also define measurements for the risks we identified in the chapter 6.1.2. Please check the Risk assessment and Action plan for examples.\n    \n*   If there is a risk that is above your acceptance criteria but cant or should not be treated, you should document that risk as “accepted by management”. This should be reserved for rare cases. If you are unsure what risks can be accepted even if they exceed the acceptance criteria, please contact us in the Community.\n    \n*   Identified measurements should be documented in the Action plan as “One-Time” Actions. The number of the action can be referenced in the risk assessment.\n    \n    > **Example**: You identified a risk regarding system failures. Backups are only done on a weekly basis, and therefore a system failure would lead to one week of data loss. You define the configuration of daily backups as measurement to lower the risk and document that in the Action plan.\n    \n*   Make sure that the documented Deadline is before your planned certification date and all defined actions are implemented before your certification. Ideally your identified risks should have a risk Level within your acceptance criteria when you finish your 27001 implementation.",

Because the customer operates in a security relevant space (banking) you assess the risk of interception of communication. Based on that, you define a measurement to secure the communication with the customer about the project. From time-to-time, you check if employees comply with this measurement and use the secure communication channel.\n\nAdditional to security measurements you define for a project by your own standard, there might be additional requirements from customers and contracts (certain security level or measurements) or legal authorites (reporting requirements, consideration of intellectual property rights) that you should take into account for projects.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n✅ Implement\n-----------\n\n**We provided some documents for you that you can find in the documents area of Cybermap:**\n\n*   [Project management](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/project-management-policy)\n    \n*   [List of projects](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/list-of-projects)\n    \n\n*   [Change management](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/change-management-policy)\n    \n*   [Change Management Plan](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/change-management-plan)\n    \n\n**Make sure to implement as follows:**\n\n*   Our approach at Cybermap is to distinguish between project management for internal & customer projects and change management which includes IT/ICT projects.\n    \n*   **Project Management**\n    \n    *   Implement the process project management. The table “Responsibilities” defines at what stages the ISO is consulted to assess the project, risk and define measurements.\n        \n    *   If you have a high volume of customer projects, you might want to consider differing between internal and customer projects when defining the responsibilities.\n        \n    *   Document your current and planned projects in the list of projects and treat them like defined in the project management.\n        \n    *   For projects that are (strictly) confidential, we suggest to perform a risk analysis.\n        \n    *   If you have comparable, repeating projects with a customer (for example a contract over 3 years to do multiple projects in software development) you can treat these contracts as a single project to avoid lengthy documentation of each sub-project. Prerequisite for that is, that the sub-projects have comparable character and security requirements.\n        \n    *   You might already have project documentation in other places or systems.

For example, if you refer “Employee PCs” as single assets, name the system that manages them (e.g. Active Directory).\n    \n*   Ensure that the check of the asset inventory is carried out at least yearly and in case of major organizational changes.

          "🔎 Understand\n-------------\n\n> Processes and procedures should be defined and implemented to manage the information security risks associated with the use of supplier's products or services.\n> \n> **_ISO® 27001_**\n\nThe norm wants to achieve that external services that have an influence on your information security are identified, risk assessed and managed.\n\nFor example: A vendor that has access to your entrance building may pose a risk, your ERP SaaS provider managing all your data may pose a bigger risk.\n\nThese risks should be mitigated and limited through measurements on your side or measurements on the provider side which can be ensured by a contract.\n\nManaging vendor risk is for sure complex, but neverless important. We suggest in any case to consider, how to execute it in detail. If you want to move fast, it may be more than often sensibly to accept the vendor terms when they pose sufficient security level instead of enforcing your own terms. Especially when there is no other possibility (big tech).\n\nCybermap provides multiple documents for this topic inside the folder “Supplier policy”. Here is an overview:\n\n*   **Supplier policy:** Your internal general policy.\n    \n*   **Supplier assessment:** Supplier assessment for identifying and managing suppliers\n    \n*   **Supplier self-disclosure form:** A self-disclosure form for suppliers, who may not be able to provide documents or certificates regarding information security.\n    \n*   **Supplementary agreement:** A contract addendum for ensuring your security level, in case the supplier does not respect information security in his contracts or your requirements are higher.\n    \n*   **Non-disclosure agreement (NDA):** An NDA template for signing with contractors if they don’t provide one.\n    \n*   **Granted contractor accesses:** A possibility to document granted access for contractors to track and withdraw access in the future.\n    \n\nAs you may want to acquire new IT-systems, hardware or software through changing suppliers to ensure best prices, you may don’t want to assess every single supplier for a small order. Therefore, we developed the **IT procurement policy**. This policy poses requirements on the single acquisition / hardware rather then assessing the supplier to ease the process.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n✅ Implement\n-----------\n\n**We provided some documents for you that you can find in the documents area of Cybermap:**\n\n*   [Supplier policy](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/supplier-policy)\n    \n*   [IT procurement policy](https://cybermap.circle.so/c/all-documents/it-procurement-policy)\n    \n\n**Make sure to implement as follows:**\n\n*   Check and implement all documents part of “Supplier policy” and the “IT procurement policy”\n    \n    *   Start with the supplier policy itself.\n        \n    *   Adjust them to your security requirements.\n        \n*   For start, assess your top 3 security relevant suppliers (e.g. cloud provider, it service company and such) to check your assessment process.\n    \n*   After the first three are assessed, re-check your requirements under the following aspects:\n    \n    *   Are your requirements appropriate?\n        \n    *   Can your requirements be adjusted to allow for an easier assessment, e.g. that can be conducted without signing additional documents with the vendor (often, vendors provide information about their security measurements or certifications on their website).\n        \n    *   Can the assessment be adjusted so that less departments are involved to speed things up?\n        \n*   As information security is more and more important and carried out by vendors, most of them will probably pass your assessment. For those who don’t, extra measurements can be carried out like additional contracts, trainings or auditing them. Be careful where to apply these measurements, tho. For example an audit is time consuming and could be speared for exceptional situations, like a breach of contract or a security incident.\n    \n*   Supplier assessment should be revised regularly (e.g. yearly) and unscheduled in case of serious incidents.
